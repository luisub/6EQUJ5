DESIGNATION: FASR-SCAN-H
NAME: Heptapod Signal
CONSTELLATION: Unknown — source location indeterminate
COORDINATES: Detected during SCAN sweep (no fixed coordinates)
DISTANCE: Unknown
CLASSIFICATION: LEVEL 7 — RESTRICTED

TEMPORAL OFFSET:
  Earth reference:  2026 CE
  Their epoch:      Non-linear — past and future co-present
  Relative offset:  Indeterminate (time is non-sequential)
  Time perception:  Simultaneous — all moments exist at once

SPECIES PROFILE:
  Form:           Seven-limbed radially symmetrical beings
  Communication:  Semasiographic — non-linear written symbols
  Disposition:    Generous, patient, purpose-driven
  Intelligence:   Transcendent — perceives time non-linearly
  First contact:  Anomalous signal detected during routine SCAN

LORE:
  The Heptapod signal was not found in any catalog. It appeared
  during a routine SCAN sweep as an anomaly that should not
  have existed — a signal with no fixed origin point, arriving
  simultaneously from multiple sky quadrants as if the source
  existed outside conventional spacetime.

  The Heptapods communicate through semasiography: a writing
  system where symbols convey meaning directly, without
  mapping to spoken language. Their circular logograms encode
  entire sentences simultaneously — beginning and end are
  written at the same moment, because to the Heptapods, the
  distinction between beginning and end does not exist.

  Their gift is perspective. To learn their language is to
  begin perceiving time as they do — not as a river flowing
  in one direction, but as a landscape where all moments are
  visible at once. They came to offer this gift. The question
  is whether humanity is ready to receive it.

REFERENCE CONTEXT:
  Canonical origin:   Narrative construct inspired by linguistic
                      first-contact fiction (non-astronomical source)
  Sky position:       Intentionally undefined in game canon
  Detection mode:     Emergent SCAN anomaly (multi-quadrant appearance)
  Physical status:    No corresponding confirmed astronomical object

SCIENTIFIC INTERPRETATION NOTE:
  This entry is deliberately speculative and functions as a
  conceptual bridge between SETI-style signal analysis and
  thought experiments about language, cognition, and time.

WORLD-BUILDING FUNCTION:
  FASR-SCAN-H is the system's "edge case" civilization:
  not tied to one catalog coordinate, but to a different model
  of perception. It exists to stress-test the operator's
  assumptions about causality and communication.
