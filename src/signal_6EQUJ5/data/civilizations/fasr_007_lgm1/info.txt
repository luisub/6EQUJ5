DESIGNATION: FASR-007
NAME: LGM-1 (CP 1919)
CONSTELLATION: Vulpecula
COORDINATES: RA 19h19m / DEC +21°47'
DISTANCE: 2,065 ly
CLASSIFICATION: HISTORICAL

TEMPORAL OFFSET:
  Earth reference:  2026 CE
  Their epoch:      Approximately 4,000 years ahead of Earth
  Relative offset:  +4,000 years (estimated)
  Time perception:  Linear, accelerated — compressed innovation cycles

SPECIES PROFILE:
  Form:           Tall insectoid — articulated exoskeleton, 6 limbs
  Communication:  Precision radio beacons (1.337-second period)
  Disposition:    Insulted, meticulous, grudge-holding
  Intelligence:   Superior — emphasis on engineering and mathematics
  First contact:  1967 (Jocelyn Bell, designated "Little Green Men")

LORE:
  When Jocelyn Bell detected the first pulsar in 1967, the
  Cambridge team half-jokingly designated it "LGM-1" — Little
  Green Men. They were joking. The builders of the beacon were
  not amused.

  CP 1919 is not a natural pulsar. It is a precision-engineered
  navigational beacon, one node in a vast interstellar
  positioning network built by a species of meticulous
  insectoid engineers. The 1.337-second period is not random —
  it is a mathematical constant in their base-12 number system,
  equivalent to broadcasting "THIS IS A MADE THING" in
  universal mathematics.

  They are aware that humanity dismissed their beacon as a
  natural phenomenon. They consider this an insult of the
  highest order. Their messages tend to be terse, precise,
  and faintly condescending. They have been building beacons
  for longer than humans have been walking upright, and they
  do not appreciate having their work mistaken for geology.

VERIFIED OBSERVATIONAL DATA:
  Alternate IDs:      CP 1919, PSR B1919+21, PSR J1921+2153
  Object class:       Radio pulsar (first discovered pulsar)
  Discovery date:     1967 (Cambridge, Bell Burnell and Hewish team)
  Pulse period:       ~1.3373 seconds
  Historical label:   "LGM-1" (initial internal nickname)
  Distance estimate:  Roughly a few thousand light-years (model-dependent)

SCIENTIFIC STATUS:
  LGM-1 is now understood as a natural rotating neutron star. Its
  importance is historical and methodological: it established pulsars
  as a new astrophysical class and transformed time-domain radio
  astronomy.

REFERENCE BASE:
  Discovery-era Cambridge records, Nature pulsar papers, and
  modern pulsar timing catalogs.
