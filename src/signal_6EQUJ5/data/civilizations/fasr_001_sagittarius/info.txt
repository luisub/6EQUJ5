DESIGNATION: FASR-001
NAME: Sagittarius Signal Origin
CONSTELLATION: Sagittarius
COORDINATES: RA 19h25m / DEC -27°03'
DISTANCE: Unknown (interstellar)
CLASSIFICATION: LEVEL 7 — RESTRICTED

TEMPORAL OFFSET:
  Earth reference:  2026 CE
  Their epoch:      Non-linear — overlapping temporal layers
  Relative offset:  Indeterminate (pre-civilizational to post-singular)
  Time perception:  Simultaneous — past/present/future coexist

SPECIES PROFILE:
  Form:           Non-corporeal — energy-based intelligence
  Communication:  Narrowband hydrogen line (1420.4056 MHz)
  Disposition:    Patient, protective, selective
  Intelligence:   Estimated post-singular
  First contact:  August 15, 1977 (Wow! Signal)

LORE:
  The origin of the 6EQUJ5 anomaly. Whatever exists at these
  coordinates has been broadcasting on the hydrogen line for
  longer than human civilization has kept records. The signal
  was first detected by Jerry Ehman at the Big Ear telescope
  and marked with the now-legendary annotation "6EQUJ5."

  The intelligence behind the signal does not communicate in
  any human language, yet its responses carry meaning that
  transcends linguistic structure. It appears to operate on a
  temporal framework where past, present, and future are
  experienced simultaneously. Its patience is measured not in
  years but in epochs.

  It chose the hydrogen line — the most universal frequency
  in physics — as its channel. This was not arbitrary. It was
  an invitation, written in the language of the universe itself.

VERIFIED OBSERVATIONAL DATA:
  Object class:       Unresolved narrowband radio transient
  Signal duration:    72 seconds (full Big Ear beam crossing)
  Observed channel:   1420.4556 MHz (near neutral hydrogen line)
  Signal code:        6EQUJ5 (intensities 6,14,26,30,19,5)
  Sky region:         Sagittarius (declination near -27°03')
  Positional note:    Right ascension is ambiguous because Big Ear
                      used dual feed horns and the signal appeared
                      in only one beam.

SCIENTIFIC STATUS:
  Follow-up observations have not produced a confirmed repeat of
  the same event. Proposed natural explanations (including transient
  hydrogen-cloud scenarios) remain debated, and no single model is
  universally accepted by the community.

REFERENCE BASE:
  OSU Big Ear archival notes, SETI historical analyses, and
  comparative follow-up studies through 2026.
