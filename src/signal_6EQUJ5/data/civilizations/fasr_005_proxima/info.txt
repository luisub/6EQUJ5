DESIGNATION: FASR-005
NAME: Proxima Centauri
CONSTELLATION: Centaurus
COORDINATES: RA 14h29m / DEC -62°40'
DISTANCE: 4.24 ly (nearest star)
CLASSIFICATION: MONITORED

TEMPORAL OFFSET:
  Earth reference:  2026 CE
  Their epoch:      Roughly contemporary — industrial to digital age
  Relative offset:  Within ±500 years of Earth development
  Time perception:  Linear, similar to human experience

SPECIES PROFILE:
  Form:           Bipedal humanoid — adapted to tidally locked world
  Communication:  Narrowband 982.002 MHz (BLC1 candidate signal)
  Disposition:    Diplomatic, cautious, formal
  Intelligence:   Comparable to human — emphasis on social structure
  First contact:  BLC1 signal candidate, 2020

LORE:
  Proxima Centauri b orbits within the habitable zone of the
  nearest star to Earth. One hemisphere faces perpetual day
  while the other endures eternal night. Life evolved in the
  twilight zone — the narrow band where temperatures permit
  liquid water and the light is forever amber.

  The inhabitants are diplomats by nature. On a world where
  one side burns and the other freezes, survival requires
  negotiation — between light and dark, heat and cold, the
  settlers of the day-side and the miners of the night-side.
  Their entire civilization is built on consensus.

  The BLC1 signal detected in 2020 was initially dismissed as
  interference. FASR analysis suggests otherwise. The signal
  carried structure: a formal greeting, a declaration of
  peaceful intent, and a request for acknowledgment. They
  have been waiting for a reply.

VERIFIED OBSERVATIONAL DATA:
  Alternate IDs:      Proxima Centauri, Alpha Centauri C
  Star type:          M5.5Ve red dwarf (flare-active)
  Distance:           ~4.2465 light-years (nearest known star)
  Known planets:      Proxima b confirmed; additional candidates debated
  Proxima b period:   ~11.2 days
  Proxima b mass:     ~1.1 Earth masses (minimum mass estimate)
  Proxima b orbit:    ~0.0485 AU from host star
  Habitability caveat: Frequent stellar flares may stress atmospheres

SCIENTIFIC STATUS:
  Proxima b is one of the strongest nearby rocky-planet targets for
  atmospheric characterization. The 2020 BLC1 signal candidate is now
  generally treated as terrestrial interference, not confirmed ETI.

REFERENCE BASE:
  ESO radial-velocity results, NASA Exoplanet Archive records,
  and SETI/Breakthrough Listen technical follow-up.
