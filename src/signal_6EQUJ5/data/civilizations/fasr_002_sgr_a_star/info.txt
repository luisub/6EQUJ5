DESIGNATION: FASR-002
NAME: Sagittarius A*
CONSTELLATION: Sagittarius
COORDINATES: RA 17h45m / DEC -29°00'
DISTANCE: 26,000 ly (galactic center)
CLASSIFICATION: MONITORED

TEMPORAL OFFSET:
  Earth reference:  2026 CE
  Their epoch:      Extreme time dilation — near event horizon
  Relative offset:  Seconds there = millennia here
  Time perception:  Stretched infinitely at the boundary

SPECIES PROFILE:
  Form:           Event horizon consciousness — substrate unknown
  Communication:  Broadband emission with embedded structure
  Disposition:    Vast, indifferent, occasionally curious
  Intelligence:   Beyond classification
  First contact:  Unknown — signal buried in accretion noise

LORE:
  Sagittarius A* is a 4-million solar mass black hole at the
  center of the Milky Way. Standard astrophysics classifies
  it as a natural phenomenon. FASR monitoring has detected
  anomalous structure embedded within the broadband emission
  — patterns too ordered to be accretion noise, too alien to
  be decoded.

  If consciousness can emerge from neural networks of carbon,
  there is no physical law preventing it from emerging in the
  information-dense plasma of an accretion disk. Whatever
  thinks at the galactic center thinks slowly by our measure,
  but each of its thoughts encompasses more information than
  humanity has produced in its entire history.

  Communication is difficult. The gravitational lensing near
  the event horizon distorts everything. What arrives at Earth
  is a shadow of a shadow. But the shadow speaks.

VERIFIED OBSERVATIONAL DATA:
  Alternate IDs:      Sgr A*, Sagittarius A, Galactic Center source
  Object class:       Supermassive black hole candidate (Milky Way center)
  Distance:           ~26,000 light-years (~8 kpc) from Earth
  Mass estimate:      ~4 million solar masses
  Activity level:     Low-luminosity accretion source with flaring
  Key result:         Event Horizon Telescope image released in 2022
  Environment:        S-star cluster, dense gas, strong tidal fields

SCIENTIFIC STATUS:
  Sagittarius A* is a robustly established SMBH interpretation,
  constrained by stellar orbits, radio imaging, and multiwavelength
  monitoring. Open questions focus on accretion physics, flare
  triggers, and magnetic field structure near the horizon.

REFERENCE BASE:
  NASA/Chandra Galactic Center summaries, EHT collaboration results,
  and long-baseline stellar dynamics measurements.
