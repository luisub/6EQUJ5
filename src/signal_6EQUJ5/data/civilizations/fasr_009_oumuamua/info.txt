CONSTELLATION: Taurus
COORDINATES: RA 03h50m / DEC +23°58' (last known vector)
DISTANCE: Variable — interstellar trajectory
CLASSIFICATION: ANOMALOUS

TEMPORAL OFFSET:
  Earth reference:  2026 CE
  Their epoch:      Hundreds of millions of years old
  Relative offset:  ~300 million years ahead (estimated launch date)
  Time perception:  Dormant — periodic awakening cycles

SPECIES PROFILE:
  Form:           Ancient probe intelligence — elongated vessel
  Communication:  Echo-like patterns at extreme range
  Disposition:    Observational, archival, non-interventionist
  Intelligence:   Autonomous AI — original builders unknown
  First contact:  1I/2017 U1 solar system transit

LORE:
  On October 19, 2017, the Pan-STARRS telescope detected the
  first confirmed interstellar object passing through our solar
  system. It was tumbling, elongated, and displayed unexplained
  non-gravitational acceleration as it departed. Officially,
  this was attributed to outgassing. The problem: no outgassing
  was observed.

  FASR deep-range monitoring detected faint echo-like patterns
  along Oumuamua's departure vector — responses to the solar
  radiation that hit the object during its transit. The patterns
  carried structure: a census of the inner planets, elemental
  composition of the solar wind, and what appears to be a
  classification code.

  Oumuamua is a probe. It was not sent by anything that still
  exists in biological form — its builders launched it hundreds
  of millions of years ago. It has visited thousands of star
  systems, cataloging each one. We are an entry in a database
  older than complex life on Earth.

VERIFIED OBSERVATIONAL DATA:
  Official ID:        1I/2017 U1 ('Oumuamua)
  Object class:       First confirmed interstellar object in Solar System
  Discovery date:     2017-10-19 (Pan-STARRS 1)
  Perihelion date:    2017-09-09
  Perihelion distance: ~0.25 AU (inside Mercury's orbit)
  Hyperbolic excess speed: ~26 km/s (interstellar inbound/outbound frame)
  Peak heliocentric speed: >80 km/s near perihelion
  Morphology:         Few-hundred-meter scale body; shape still debated
  Key anomaly:        Non-gravitational acceleration without classic comet coma

SCIENTIFIC STATUS:
  Competing explanations include outgassing by hard-to-detect volatiles,
  radiation-pressure effects on unusual geometry, or other non-standard
  surface/thermal physics. No consensus model explains all observations
  without tradeoffs.

REFERENCE BASE:
  MPC/JPL trajectory solutions, Pan-STARRS discovery reports, and
  post-2017 dynamical/physical modeling literature.
