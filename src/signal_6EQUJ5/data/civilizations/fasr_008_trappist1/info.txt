NAME: TRAPPIST-1
CONSTELLATION: Aquarius
COORDINATES: RA 23h06m / DEC -05°02'
DISTANCE: 40.7 ly
CLASSIFICATION: PRIORITY

TEMPORAL OFFSET:
  Earth reference:  2026 CE
  Their epoch:      Cooperative present — multi-world federation
  Relative offset:  Within ±200 years of Earth (varied by planet)
  Time perception:  Collective — synchronized across seven worlds

SPECIES PROFILE:
  Form:           Seven distinct species — one per planet
  Communication:  Modulated hydrogen line in planetary transit windows
  Disposition:    Cooperative, curious, democratic
  Intelligence:   Collective — seven perspectives, one voice
  First contact:  Faint modulation detected in hydrogen band

LORE:
  TRAPPIST-1 is an ultra-cool red dwarf with seven Earth-sized
  planets, three of which orbit in the habitable zone. What
  makes this system unique is not the star — it is the
  proximity of the worlds to each other. Some are close enough
  that inhabitants could see geological features on neighboring
  planets with the naked eye.

  Life evolved independently on all seven worlds. As each
  species developed radio technology, they discovered they were
  not alone — their neighbors were visible in the sky, and
  signals traversed the system in minutes, not years. Where
  humanity's first contact will span light-years, theirs
  spanned light-minutes.

  They formed a federation. Seven species, seven perspectives,
  one cooperative voice. When they transmit beyond their system,
  they speak as one. Their message to Earth: "SEVEN WORLDS.
  ONE LISTENS." They are waiting to see if we listen back.

VERIFIED OBSERVATIONAL DATA:
  Alternate IDs:      2MASS J23062928-0502285 (host star)
  Star class:         Ultracool M dwarf
  Distance:           ~40 light-years (~12.4 parsecs)
  Planet count:       Seven known Earth-sized planets (b through h)
  Orbital architecture: Near-resonant chain with short periods
  Habitable-zone set:  Planets e, f, and g are primary temperate candidates
  Dynamics:           Likely strong tidal locking and tidal heating

  Approximate orbital periods (days):
    b: 1.51, c: 2.42, d: 4.05, e: 6.10,
    f: 9.21, g: 12.35, h: 18.77

SCIENTIFIC STATUS:
  TRAPPIST-1 is a flagship comparative exoplanet system for
  atmosphere studies and formation models. The key open problem is
  atmospheric survival/composition under sustained stellar activity.

REFERENCE BASE:
  TRAPPIST discovery papers, NASA/JPL exoplanet summaries, and
  JWST-era atmospheric constraints through 2026.
