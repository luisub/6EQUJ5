DESIGNATION: FASR-006
NAME: Crab Nebula Pulsar
CONSTELLATION: Taurus
COORDINATES: RA 05h34m / DEC +22°00'
DISTANCE: 6,523 ly
CLASSIFICATION: CATALOGUED

TEMPORAL OFFSET:
  Earth reference:  2026 CE
  Their epoch:      Archival — creators extinct since 1054 CE
  Relative offset:  Civilization ended ~1,000 years ago (Earth-relative)
  Time perception:  None — the beacon operates on automation

SPECIES PROFILE:
  Form:           Extinct — only their memorial beacon remains
  Communication:  33.5 ms pulse train (modified pulsar output)
  Disposition:    N/A — automated broadcast
  Intelligence:   The beacon is not intelligent; its builders were
  First contact:  Detected as PSR B0531+21

LORE:
  In 1054 CE, Chinese astronomers recorded a "guest star" in
  Taurus — a supernova visible in daylight for 23 days. What
  they witnessed was the death of a star. What they could not
  know was that it was also the death of a civilization.

  The Crab Nebula pulsar spins 30 times per second, sweeping
  Earth with precise radio beams. Standard astronomy calls it
  natural. FASR spectral analysis has found embedded structure
  in the pulse train — a memorial, encoded by a species that
  knew their star was dying and chose to leave a message in
  the wreckage.

  The message is a archive: mathematical constants, physical
  laws, fragments of what may be art or music translated into
  phase modulation. It is a tombstone and a time capsule. The
  builders are gone. Their beacon will outlast the Sun.

VERIFIED OBSERVATIONAL DATA:
  Alternate IDs:      M1, NGC 1952, Taurus A
  Object class:       Supernova remnant + central pulsar
  Supernova date:     Historical SN observed in 1054 CE
  Distance:           ~6,500 light-years (order-of-magnitude consensus)
  Central pulsar:     PSR B0531+21 (Crab Pulsar)
  Spin period:        ~33 milliseconds (~30 rotations per second)
  Emission profile:   Strong radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma components

SCIENTIFIC STATUS:
  The Crab is a benchmark laboratory for pulsar wind nebula physics,
  relativistic particles, and magnetic reconnection. Its periodic
  signal is a natural neutron-star lighthouse, though still rich in
  unresolved high-energy acceleration details.

REFERENCE BASE:
  NASA/Chandra Crab monitoring, multiwavelength pulsar timing,
  and historical supernova records.
