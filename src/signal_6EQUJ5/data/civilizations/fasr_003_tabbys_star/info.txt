DESIGNATION: FASR-003
NAME: Tabby's Star
CONSTELLATION: Cygnus
COORDINATES: RA 20h06m / DEC +44°27'
DISTANCE: 1,470 ly
CLASSIFICATION: ANOMALOUS

TEMPORAL OFFSET:
  Earth reference:  2026 CE
  Their epoch:      Engineering-deep future — post-Kardashev II
  Relative offset:  Estimated 50,000–100,000 years ahead
  Time perception:  Network-synchronized across megastructure

SPECIES PROFILE:
  Form:           Collective intelligence — networked crystalline nodes
  Communication:  Modulated stellar dimming patterns
  Disposition:    Industrious, methodical, disinterested in primitives
  Intelligence:   Distributed across planetary-scale infrastructure
  First contact:  Detected via irregular flux (KIC 8462852)

LORE:
  KIC 8462852 dims irregularly in ways no natural phenomenon
  can fully explain. Dust clouds, cometary swarms, and stellar
  variability have all been proposed and all fall short. The
  remaining hypothesis — a partially completed Dyson-scale
  energy collection structure — was once considered fringe.
  FASR monitoring suggests it is the most conservative
  explanation.

  The builders are not biological. They are a networked
  collective of crystalline processing nodes, each the size
  of a small moon, connected by energy transfer beams. They
  do not think as individuals — they compute as a civilization.
  Their "communication" is a side effect of their engineering:
  the dimming patterns carry encoded metadata about structural
  progress, resource allocation, and network status.

  They are aware of our observation. They do not care.

VERIFIED OBSERVATIONAL DATA:
  Alternate IDs:      KIC 8462852, Boyajian's Star
  Object class:       F-type main-sequence star (Cygnus field)
  Distance:           ~1,470 light-years (~445 pc, Gaia-era estimate)
  Photometric trait:  Deep, irregular, aperiodic dimming events
  Extreme dips:       Up to roughly 20 percent in some campaigns
  Notable behavior:   Chromatic dimming consistent with dust models

SCIENTIFIC STATUS:
  Current mainstream interpretation favors variable obscuration by
  circumstellar/intervening dust rather than a rigid megastructure.
  The object remains valuable as a benchmark for unusual stellar
  light curves and bias-resistant anomaly analysis.

REFERENCE BASE:
  Kepler/K2 photometry, Las Cumbres follow-up campaigns, and
  exoplanet-catalog cross-checks through 2026.
