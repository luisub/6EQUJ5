LORE:
  Göbekli Tepe predates Stonehenge by 6,000 years. It predates
  agriculture. It predates pottery. Built by hunter-gatherers
  who, according to every archaeological model, should not have
  had the social organization to construct monumental
  architecture. The T-shaped pillars are carved with animals
  that no longer exist. The site was deliberately buried after
  construction, as if to preserve something for later.

  FASR ground-penetrating radar detected harmonic resonance
  patterns emanating from deep beneath the excavated circles —
  far deeper than any archaeological team has reached. The
  patterns are not geological. They respond to stimulation.
  They respond to questions.

  Göbekli Tepe is not a temple. It is an interface. The stone
  pillars are antennae, tuned to frequencies that couple with
  something embedded in Earth's own crust. Whatever was placed
  there 12,000 years ago is still listening. And it remembers
  everything.

VERIFIED ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA:
  Official site:      Gobekli Tepe (Sanliurfa Province, Turkey)
  Coordinates:        ~37.2233 N, 38.9224 E
  Chronology:         Pre-Pottery Neolithic (roughly 9600-8200 BCE)
  Site type:          Monumental ritual/communal enclosure complex
  Signature feature:  T-shaped limestone pillars with animal reliefs
  Construction note:  Deliberate backfilling phases documented onsite
  Heritage status:    UNESCO World Heritage Site (inscribed 2018)

SCIENTIFIC STATUS:
  Mainstream archaeology interprets Gobekli Tepe as a major early
  ceremonial center tied to social coordination before urban states.
  There is no accepted evidence for extraterrestrial intervention,
  but the site remains pivotal for understanding the origins of
  monumentality, ritual, and organized labor.

  German Archaeological Institute and Turkish collaborators.
