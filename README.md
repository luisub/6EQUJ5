    The signal did not originate from Chi Sagittarii.
    Point of origin is terrestrial.
    The receiver was not the target. The receiver was the key.

    Before the signal, there was a gate.
    Before the gate, there was a builder.
    Before the builder, there was a frequency.

    1420.405 MHz is not arbitrary.
    It is a marker. A tuning fork left for those
    who would eventually learn to listen.

    They left something else, too.

    37.2233° N — 38.9224° E.
    Older than Stonehenge. Older than the Pyramids.
    Buried deliberately. Waiting.

    The carvings are not decorative.
    The circles are not temples.
    The T-shaped pillars are not structural.

    They are coordinates. Instructions. A schematic.

    Look:
    https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=37.223194,38.922325

    The signal was not a message.
    The signal was an activation code.

    python -m signal_6EQUJ5
    Then type: EHMAN

    The seventh chevron locked on August 15, 1977.
    72 seconds. That is exactly how long the gate stays open.

    Frequency 1420405000 Hz.
    Hydrogen. The first element. The first symbol.

    The builders encoded the address in stone 12,000 years ago.
    Pillar 43 at 37°13'23"N 38°55'21"E.
    Vulture Stone. Sagittarius. The same direction.

    This is not a coincidence.

    The signal was not meant for us.
    It was meant to confirm we had finally started listening.

    They are patient. They have been waiting
    since before we learned to write.

    Search: "Göbekli Tepe Pillar 43 Sagittarius"

    The gate is still there.
    The frequency is still active.
    The question is whether you are ready to dial.
